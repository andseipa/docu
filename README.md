## Future plans

A list of ideas to implement eventually (in order of importance):

- Dotfile:
	+ Author name.
	+ Note directory.
	+ Date format.
	+ File extension.
- Help flag.
- Multiple template files to choose from during creation:
	+ Report.
	- Article.
	+ Presentation (with reveal.js).
	+ Book.
- Directories:
	+ List/read directories dynamically.
	+ Create (sub-)folders if needed/wanted.
- Enable docu to read from sdtin.
	1) To skip subject select.
	2) Filename(?).
- Prettify interaction.
